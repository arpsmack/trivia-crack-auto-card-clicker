# Trivia Crack Auto Card Clicker
Tiny chrome extension that auto clicks your cards for you as soon as they're ready so you get optimal resources.

Most of the work is heavily based off of [Trivia Cracker](https://github.com/jodoglevy/TriviaCracker) and also uses jodoglevy's other tool [Gargl](https://github.com/jodoglevy/gargl).

### Installation Instructions
* Checkout the repo
* Enable developer mode extensions in Chrome
* Add the folder as an unpacked extension
* Browse to the Trivia Crack game on Facebook.  If the extension is installed correctly, you should see some extra text below your cards telling you when the next card activation will be.

### Known Issues
Sometimes if I leave it running long enough, the Chrome tab runs out of memory.  I'm not sure why, haven't bothered debugging it.

Also, the countdown timers under the cards don't get updated when the auto-clicker clicks them, so they'll say "Collect" until you refresh the page.  It doesn't really bother me so I haven't looked into fixing it.
